This is inline <span class="Special">`</span><span class="Constant">code</span><span class="Special">`</span> with a single back tick

This is inline <span class="Special">``</span><span class="Constant">code</span><span class="Special">``</span> with double back ticks

This is inline <span class="Special">```</span><span class="Constant">code</span><span class="Special">```</span> with triple back ticks. This is not standard Markdown but Github supports it and so do we. Actually Github allows an arbitrary number of backs ticks around inline <span class="Special">`````</span><span class="Constant">codeblocks</span><span class="Special">`````</span> the only constraint is that they should be <span class="Special">```</span><span class="Constant">even</span><span class="Special">```</span>` the remainder, in this case the last back tick, should not be highlighted

The following is a generic block code with a triple tick
<span class="Special">```</span>
<span class="Constant">code</span>
<span class="Special">```</span>

The following is a fenced block code with a triple tick
<span class="Special">```js</span>
<span class="Constant">var foo = 'bar'</span>
<span class="Special">```</span>

A fenced code block must have at least 3 back ticks in the start delimiter but could have more
<span class="Special">````````ruby</span>
<span class="Constant">foo = 'bar' if foo.empty?</span>
<span class="Special">```</span>

A fenced code block must have at least 3 back ticks in the end delimiter but could have more
<span class="Special">```ruby</span>
<span class="Constant">foo = 'bar' if foo.empty?</span>
<span class="Special">````````</span>

A fenced code block could have at most 3 leading spaces in the start delimiter
<span class="Special">   ```ruby</span>
<span class="Constant">foo = 'bar' if foo.empty?</span>
<span class="Special">```</span>

A fenced code block could have at most 3 leading spaces in the end delimiter
<span class="Special">```ruby</span>
<span class="Constant">foo = 'bar' if foo.empty?</span>
<span class="Special">   ```</span>

A fenced code block could have at most 3 leading spaces in the start and in the end delimiter
<span class="Special">  ```ruby</span>
<span class="Constant">foo = 'bar' if foo.empty?</span>
<span class="Special"> ```</span>


<span class="Constant">    this is a code block because it's indented with 4 spaces</span>
<span class="Constant">    this should be a continuation</span>

This line separates two blocks

<span class="Constant">  this is a code block because it's indented with a \t</span>
<span class="Constant">  this should be a continuation</span>


The following is not standard Markdown, officially it's not the Github Flavored Markdown either, it's inspired by the Kramdown Flavored Markdown. Even if not documented Github supports it and so do we
